Linux File Structure:
    /  is the root Directory in Linux servers *##

/home - user's home Directory details 
======
ec2-user 
mylandmarktech 
simon 
linux  

/bin = contains binary files [commands]
=====
  ls 
  pwd = print working Directory 
  whoami 
  cd  = change Directory
  cat = displays the content of a file 
  clear = 

/sbin - contains system binary files [commands]
=====
  - contains system binary files [commands]
    Executed ONLY by priviledge/admin/root users 
  - adduser simon
  - passwd simon

IQ: What is the difference between bin and sbin in Linux?: 
 sbin are binary flies only executable by users 
   with admin and elevated priviledges 
 bin files are executable by any user 
 ls = list the content of a Directory

IQ: Explain how users are categorised in Linux?  ****
    We have three category of users in Linux:

    1. admin/root user  = super user that runs all commands 
    2. normal users  = runs executables in /bin 
    3. system users 
        Users created when we install certain softwares 

/etc = contains configuration files 
=====
  /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
  /etc/shadow  = detail information about users password 
  /etc/passwd  = detail information about users 
     cat /etc/passwd
 
/tmp == temporal Directory 
============

/opt  = Where softwares and packages are installed
=====
lib  = 
====
proc 
=======
-  meminfo 
-  cpuinfo 
var = dynamic files [logs]
========================== 
 - /var/lob/messages 
    sudo cat /var/log/messages
============
/
ls /  
bin   data  etc   lib    media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  dev   home  lib64  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var

ls /var/log = list the content of the /var/log directory:

mkdir -v test 
           -v verbose  (TO MAKE DIRECTORY AND REPORT ITS CREATION)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RENAMING YOUR SERVER To MAKE IT EASILY READ:

  sudo hostname "NEW NAME" 
  eg
  sudo hostname demo  (it will not change on comand line) we still have 
  [ec2-user@ip-172-31-83-28 ~]$
  so to make nae change on comand line?
  sudo su - ec2-user: 
  this will now change to your name you gave
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  mkdir -pv Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/Git/Maven/Nexus/
  - p = will create both parent and child Directory
  - v = verbose mode see comment above


  mkdir  Devops/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/Git/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/Git/Maven/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/Git/Maven/Nexus/
Deleting an empty directory:
   rmdir dirName 
     rmdir paypal/
   rm -r dirName
     rm -r paypal/

[ec2-user@demo ~]$ rmdir class
rmdir: failed to remove 'class': Directory not empty

Deleting a directory with content:
   rm -r dirName 
   rm -rf dirName (FORCE REMOVE)

Deleting all directories that start with a
   'class' or a 'given pattern'
   rm -rf class*  

  * = wild card 

Deleting all directories that ends with a
   'app' or a 'given pattern'
   rm -rf *app   

cd - = moves you to the  directory you were before ****:{{[]}}:

cd / 
cd /bin 
cd /etc

touch coomand:
touch goals.txt
echo command: *****
echo "JESUS IS LORD" > truth.sh  creating a file with info in it truth in any format 
      (truth .sh, truth.txt. truth .yml)
echo  DevOps is good > hired

---------------------------------------
ll or ls -l = long list the content of
              a directory

ls -lt = long list base on time  
ls -ltr = long list basll or ls -l = long list the content of
              a directory

ls -lt = long list base on time  
ls -ltr = long list base on reverse time



Why/how are some files hidden
Important files are hidden 
 to avoid accidental delete
  to avoid deleting VIP files mistakenly with 
      rm -rf class* 
      use .(filebame)
  
we create them using .
eg
  mkdir .config 
  touch .deploy 


IQ: How can you desplay hidden files/dirs?:
   ls -a 

  
  cat   /etc/shadow
  sudo cat /etc/shadow

Save and Quit: 
     type :wq and press enter key to save and quit
     do a quick double press on the shift+z key  
       to save and quit 
            press+hold 'shift key' and type ZZ
 Quit without saving:  
     enter command mode          
     type :q! and press enter key to quit 
           without saving

cat / tail / head /  less / more
less: read the contents of a file one page at a time
more: read the contents of a file showing the proportion read in percentage

MOVING AND COPYING FILES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cp = copy files [backup]  eg cp test.copy
cp test /tmp/ = to copy and put in tmp directory
cp test /tmp/ test.bk = to copy and put in tmp directory with new name as test.bk

mv = rename files/directories  (SAME AS COPY)
mv  can also rename a fine 

files:
  mv fileName 
  cp fileName

directories: 
  mv dirName can move a directory as cp but cannot copy as same we use
  
  cp -r <dirName> to copy directory
  eg 
  cp -r devops/taxi (WE ARE MOVING DEVOPS TO RENAME TAXI)


 N WORD COUNT ON FILES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
file  
wc  = word counts 
  wc -l = no of lines 
  wc -c = no of charesters in a file  
ln:  link 
  fileName =  list 
  ln list list-hard 
       = hard link  [ln/cp]
       = copy 
  ln -s list list-soft 
       = soft link 
NOTE: WHEN MAIN FILE IS DELETED, THE SOFTLINK WILL BE BLINKING AS THE CNN FILE IN MY DIRECTORIES
