#Difference between Testing and UAT (Users Aceptance and testing)
UAT is a live, public environment that is synchronized with 
production deployments but with a different data load to allow 
users to play around with the software. We refer to it as a 
Sandbox environment for users. Staging is a private place to test
 deployment and infrastructure changes before running them in 
 Production and UAT.
